  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>I was always taught that hot chocolate was made with chocolate and hot cocoa was made with cocoa powder. This is the richest hot chocolate you'll ever have. I don't remember where I got this recipe from. Add cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired. Serve in small tea or coffee cups, because it is very rich!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>6 cups half-and-half</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted and completely smooth, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add half-and-half slowly to avoid cooling chocolate mixture too much, stirring while you add it. Heat until hot but not boiling.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
