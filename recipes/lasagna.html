  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground back pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup of milk</li>
    <li>White wine</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Carrots</li>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
    <li>Spinach</li>
    <li>Mozzarella</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
    <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
    <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
